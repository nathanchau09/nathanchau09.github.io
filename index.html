<h1>        About Me</h1>
<p>     My name is Nathan Chau, and I am making this website for my Computer Science class.  I play soccer at Citrus Valley High School as an outside back, and enjoy listening to music!
    I am writing this on November 30th, 2022.  I would like to keep this website as a time capsule for me with all the memories in life that I have already made.  Maybe I can flex on my
    kids one day and tell them I have a website and they don't (Stupid little kids).  Some goals I have are; To find a job that I can be happy doing and one that I won't have to worry About
    money for myself, make sure I am healthy, keep good relationships with friends and family, and be truly happy.
